<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Structural Steel Pipe Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spiral Weld Pipe</li><li>Double Submerged Arc Weld (DSAW)</li><li>Electric Resistance Weld (ERW)</li><li>Seamless (SMLS)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The structural steel pipe market comprises various types of pipes used in construction and infrastructure projects. Spiral weld pipes are manufactured by continuously winding a strip of steel into a spiral shape, making them strong and resistant to bending. Double submerged arc weld (DSAW) pipes are produced by welding two longitudinal seams on each side of a steel plate, creating a thick and sturdy pipe. Electric resistance weld (ERW) pipes are formed by passing a high-frequency electric current through the edges of a steel strip, resulting in a strong joint. Seamless (SMLS) pipes are manufactured without any welding or seams, providing a smooth and continuous pipe.</p></p>
