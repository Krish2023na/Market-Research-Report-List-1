<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Surgical Navigation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Touch Type</li><li>Touchless Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Optical Surgical Navigation System market consists of two main types: Touch Type and Touchless Type. Touch Type systems require physical contact with the user interface, such as a screen or buttons, for interaction and control. On the other hand, Touchless Type systems employ gesture recognition or voice commands, eliminating the need for physical contact. Both types offer advanced navigation capabilities for surgeons during complex procedures, but Touchless Type systems provide a more hygienic and intuitive user experience, as they do not require direct physical interaction.</p></p>
