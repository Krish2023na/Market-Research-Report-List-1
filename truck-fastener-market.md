<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Truck Fastener Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Threaded Fasteners</li><li>Non-Threaded Fasteners</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The truck fastener market consists of two main types: threaded fasteners and non-threaded fasteners. Threaded fasteners, such as bolts and screws, have ridged exterior surfaces and require threading into pre-drilled holes for operation. They provide strong and secure connections and are commonly used in heavy-duty truck applications. On the other hand, non-threaded fasteners, like rivets and clips, do not have threads and are typically used for quick and easy assembly or disassembly of truck parts. They offer versatility and convenience in truck maintenance and repairs.</p></p>
