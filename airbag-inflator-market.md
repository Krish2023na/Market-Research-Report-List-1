<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Airbag Inflator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pyrotechnic Inflator</li><li>Stored Gas Inflator</li><li>Hybrid Inflator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The airbag inflator market consists of three main types: pyrotechnic inflator, stored gas inflator, and hybrid inflator. </p><p>Pyrotechnic inflators use a small igniter that triggers a chemical reaction. This rapid combustion produces a high-pressure gas that inflates the airbag within milliseconds. </p><p>Stored gas inflators store compressed gas in a reservoir. When triggered, the gas is swiftly released into the airbag, inflating it rapidly. </p><p>Hybrid inflators combine both pyrotechnic and stored gas elements to achieve efficient and controlled airbag deployment. They use stored compressed gas along with pyrotechnic agents to inflate the airbag effectively.</p></p>
