<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spray Foam Insulation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-Cell Foam</li><li>Closed-Cell Foam</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Spray foam insulation is categorized into two main types: open-cell foam and closed-cell foam. Open-cell foam is a lighter and less dense insulation material. It allows air and moisture to permeate through it, making it less effective as a moisture barrier but offering better sound insulation. Closed-cell foam, on the other hand, is denser and offers a higher R-value. It provides a better moisture barrier and improves structural integrity. However, closed-cell foam is more expensive than open-cell foam. Both types have their own advantages and are used for different purposes in the insulation market.</p></p>
