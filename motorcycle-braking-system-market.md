<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Motorcycle Braking System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Disc brake</li><li>Drum brake</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The motorcycle braking system market comprises two types: disc brakes and drum brakes. Disc brakes utilize a rotating disc to slow down or stop the motorcycle. They offer better stopping power, cooling ability, and are more resistant to brake fade. On the other hand, drum brakes use brake shoe and drum assembly to generate the required friction and slow down the motorcycle. Despite being less effective in terms of stopping power and heat dissipation compared to disc brakes, drum brakes are still commonly used in motorcycles due to their lower cost and durability.</p></p>
