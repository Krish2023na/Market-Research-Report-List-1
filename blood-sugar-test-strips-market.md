<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Blood Sugar Test Strips Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Glucose Oxidase</li><li>Glucose Dehydrogenase</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The blood sugar test strips market is segmented based on the types of enzymes used in the strips for glucose measurement. Glucose oxidase and glucose dehydrogenase are the two main types of enzymes. Glucose oxidase-based test strips utilize this enzyme to convert glucose into gluconic acid, leading to an electrical current change that is measured by the meter. Glucose dehydrogenase-based test strips use the enzyme to convert glucose into gluconolactone, resulting in a color change that is detected by the meter. Other types of enzymes may also be used in blood sugar test strips, but glucose oxidase and glucose dehydrogenase are the most common.</p></p>
