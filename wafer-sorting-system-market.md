<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wafer Sorting System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-Automated</li><li>Fully-Automated</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The wafer sorting system market can be classified into two types: semi-automated and fully-automated systems. Semi-automated systems involve a combination of manual and automated processes, where certain actions are performed by operators while others are carried out by machines. On the other hand, fully-automated systems require minimal human intervention as all processes are automated. These systems utilize advanced technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence to perform tasks like wafer alignment and inspection. Both types offer benefits such as increased efficiency and accuracy, but fully-automated systems typically provide higher levels of productivity and require less manpower.</p></p>
