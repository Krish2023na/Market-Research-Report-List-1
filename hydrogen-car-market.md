<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydrogen Car Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>HICEV</li><li>Fuel Cell Vehicle-FCEV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hydrogen car market consists of two main types: HICEV (Hydrogen Internal Combustion Engine Vehicle) and FCEV (Fuel Cell Vehicle). HICEVs are similar to traditional cars, where hydrogen is used as fuel for an internal combustion engine. On the other hand, FCEVs use fuel cells to convert hydrogen into electricity, which powers the vehicle. Both types offer zero-emission driving, as the only byproduct is water. However, FCEVs are generally more efficient and have a longer range compared to HICEVs.</p></p>
