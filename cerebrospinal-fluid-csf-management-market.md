<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Management Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CSF Shunts</li><li>CSF Drainage</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Management Market comprises two main types: CSF shunts and CSF drainage systems. CSF shunts are medical devices used to treat hydrocephalus, a condition that causes an abnormal build-up of CSF in the brain. These devices help divert excess fluid from the brain to other parts of the body, thus relieving pressure. On the other hand, CSF drainage systems are used to drain CSF after surgery or in cases of infection or bleeding in the brain. Both these market segments play a vital role in managing CSF-related conditions effectively.</p></p>
