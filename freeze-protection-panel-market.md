<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Freeze Protection Panel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Phase</li><li>Three-Phase</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Freeze Protection Panel market consists of two types: Single Phase and Three-Phase. Single Phase refers to a power supply system that uses only one alternating current (AC) voltage waveform, mainly for residential and small commercial applications. Three-Phase, on the other hand, utilizes three AC voltage waveforms that are 120 degrees out of phase with each other. This type is commonly used for industrial and large commercial applications due to its higher power capacity and efficiency. Both types of Freeze Protection Panels are designed to protect pipes and other equipment from freezing during low-temperature conditions.</p></p>
