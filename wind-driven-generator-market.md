<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wind-driven Generator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Asynchronous Wind-driven Generator</li><li>Synchronous Wind-driven Generator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>A wind-driven generator, also known as a wind turbine, converts wind energy into electrical energy. There are two main types of wind-driven generators: asynchronous and synchronous. </p><p>An asynchronous wind-driven generator operates at variable speeds, meaning the rotor speed is independent of the electrical frequency. This type is commonly used in small-scale applications and for grid connection in low wind speed regions. </p><p>On the other hand, a synchronous wind-driven generator operates at a fixed speed, keeping the rotor speed in sync with the electrical frequency. This type is typically used in large-scale wind farms and for grid connection in high wind speed regions.</p></p>
