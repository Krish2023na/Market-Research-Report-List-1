<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Prostate Cancer Vaccines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tablet</li><li>Injection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Prostate cancer vaccines are divided into two types: tablets and injections. Tablet vaccines are administered orally and contain antigenic components that stimulate the immune system to recognize and attack prostate cancer cells. Injection vaccines, on the other hand, are administered through injections and may contain either whole cancer cells, proteins, or nucleic acids that trigger an immune response against prostate cancer. Both types aim to activate the immune system's ability to target and destroy prostate cancer cells, but differ in their method of delivery.</p></p>
