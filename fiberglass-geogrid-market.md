<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiberglass Geogrid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Biaxial Tension</li><li>Uniaxial Tension</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fiberglass geogrid is used in civil engineering for soil stabilization and reinforcement. It comes in different types, namely biaxial tension and uniaxial tension. Biaxial tension geogrids have high strength in both directions and are suitable for applications where load is applied in multiple directions. On the other hand, uniaxial tension geogrids have high strength in one direction and are used when the load is primarily in one direction. Both types provide enhanced stability to the soil, preventing cracks and increases the overall strength of the construction.</p></p>
