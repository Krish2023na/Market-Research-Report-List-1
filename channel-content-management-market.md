In this article, we will focus on Adobe, Microsoft, and WordPress to provide a detailed overview of their past history, market growth, market size, and sales revenue.</p><p>Adobe is a well-known software company that has been in operation since 1982.

However, it is worth noting that Adobe's Digital Experience division, which includes its CCCM offering, reported $3.36 billion in revenue for the fiscal year 2020. Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud division, which includes SharePoint, generated $16.7 billion in revenue for the same period.

Adobe's history, market growth, and revenue demonstrate its position as a leader in the industry, while Microsoft leverages its brand recognition and strategic partnerships to drive market share.
