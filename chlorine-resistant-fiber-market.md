<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chlorine Resistant Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Spinning Method</li><li>Wet Spinning Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chlorine resistant fibers are used in swimwear and other applications where exposure to chlorine is common. The dry spinning method involves the fiber being extruded from a solution and then solidified using air or heat, resulting in a more durable fiber. On the other hand, the wet spinning method involves the fiber being formed by extruding a solution into a coagulating bath, which gives it a softer texture. Both methods offer chlorine resistance, but the dry spinning method is known for its superior durability while the wet spinning method offers a more comfortable feel.</p></p>
