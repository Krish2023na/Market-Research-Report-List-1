<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Portable Ammonia Nitrogen Analyzers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Colorimetric Method</li><li>Electrode Method</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Portable Ammonia Nitrogen Analyzers are used to measure the concentration of ammonia nitrogen in various samples. There are two main types of analyzers: colorimetric method and electrode method. In the colorimetric method, a chemical reaction takes place between ammonia and a reagent, resulting in a color change that is measured and correlated to the ammonia nitrogen concentration. The electrode method uses an ammonia-selective electrode to measure the electrical potential difference generated by the interaction between ammonia and the electrode surface. Both methods provide accurate and reliable measurements for on-site ammonia nitrogen analysis.</p></p>
