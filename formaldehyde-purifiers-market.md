<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Formaldehyde Purifiers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>HEPA</li><li>Ultra HEPA</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Formaldehyde purifiers are available in different types, such as HEPA and Ultra HEPA filters. HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) filters are commonly used in purifiers to remove airborne particles and pollutants, including formaldehyde, by trapping them in a fine mesh. Ultra HEPA filters, on the other hand, offer higher filtration efficiency by capturing even smaller particles. Both types help improve indoor air quality by effectively reducing the presence of formaldehyde and other harmful substances. These purifiers are widely used in residential, commercial, and industrial settings to maintain a healthier and safer environment.</p></p>
