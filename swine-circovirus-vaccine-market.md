<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Swine Circovirus Vaccine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Genetic Engineering Vaccine</li><li>Killed Vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Swine Circovirus Vaccine market includes two main types of vaccines - Genetic Engineering Vaccines and Killed Vaccines. Genetic Engineering Vaccines are developed by manipulating the DNA of the virus to create a modified version that triggers an immune response in swine. This type of vaccine is highly effective and can provide long-lasting immunity. Killed Vaccines, on the other hand, are made from inactivated or dead virus particles. These vaccines are less potent compared to genetic engineering vaccines but are still effective in preventing swine circovirus infections.</p></p>
