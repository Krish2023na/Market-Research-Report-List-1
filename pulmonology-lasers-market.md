<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pulmonology Lasers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nd-YAG Laser</li><li>Photodynamic Laser</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Pulmonology lasers include two prominent types: the Nd-YAG and the Photodynamic lasers. Nd-YAG lasers are widely used to treat various pulmonary diseases, such as lung cancer and obstructions in the airways. These lasers utilize a neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet crystal as the medium for emission. On the other hand, Photodynamic lasers employ a combination of a photosensitive drug and laser light to selectively target and destroy cancer cells while sparing healthy tissues. This technology offers a minimally invasive approach to treat lung cancer and other pulmonary conditions.</p></p>
