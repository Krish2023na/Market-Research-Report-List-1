<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Two-Wheeler Catalytic Converter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)</li><li>Lean NOx Catalysts (LNC)</li><li>Lean NOx Trap (LNT)</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The two-wheeler catalytic converter market consists of several types. Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) converters use ammonia-based catalysts to selectively convert harmful nitrogen oxides (NOx) into nitrogen gas and water vapor. Lean NOx Catalysts (LNC) convert NOx into harmless nitrogen and oxygen by using a mixture of palladium, rhodium, and platinum catalysts. Lean NOx Trap (LNT) converters store NOx emissions during low engine loads and release and convert them into nitrogen during high engine loads. Other types of converters may include diesel oxidation catalysts and particulate filters. These converters play a crucial role in reducing two-wheelers' emissions and improving air quality.</p></p>
