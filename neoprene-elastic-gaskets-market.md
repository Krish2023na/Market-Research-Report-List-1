<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neoprene Elastic Gaskets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Saddle</li><li>Waveform</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Neoprene elastic gaskets are widely used in various industries for sealing purposes. Two common types of these gaskets are saddle and waveform gaskets. Saddle gaskets have a shape resembling a saddle, with a flat top and sides that curve downwards. They are primarily used for sealing flanges with uneven surfaces. On the other hand, waveform gaskets have a wavy shape that allows for increased flexibility and compression. This makes them suitable for applications where there is a need for vibration isolation or accommodation of irregular flange surfaces.</p></p>
