<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Novolac Resins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic</li><li>Thermosetting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Novolac resins are a type of synthetic resin widely used in various industries. Thermoplastic novolac resins can be melted and reshaped multiple times without undergoing any significant chemical changes. They are flexible, moldable, and capable of retaining their original properties after cooling. On the other hand, thermosetting novolac resins become permanently rigid and infusible after curing. This process involves cross-linking of molecules, resulting in a strong and durable material that cannot be melted or reshaped. These different types of novolac resins cater to distinct market needs and applications.</p></p>
