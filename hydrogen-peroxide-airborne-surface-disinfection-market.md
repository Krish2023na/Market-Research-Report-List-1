<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydrogen Peroxide Airborne Surface Disinfection Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vaporized Type</li><li>Fogging Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hydrogen peroxide airborne surface disinfection is a method used to kill harmful microorganisms in the air and on surfaces. Two common types of this disinfection method are vaporized type and fogging type. </p><p>The vaporized type involves generating hydrogen peroxide vapor and releasing it into the air, which then settles on surfaces and kills pathogens. </p><p>The fogging type, on the other hand, entails creating a fine mist of hydrogen peroxide solution, which is sprayed into the air. This mist reaches all surfaces and effectively disinfects them. Both methods are effective in eliminating pathogens and preventing the spread of infections.</p></p>
