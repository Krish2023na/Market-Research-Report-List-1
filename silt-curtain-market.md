<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Silt Curtain Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>WovenFibres</li><li>Non-WovenFibres</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Silt curtains are used to control silt and sediment in bodies of water, and they are available in two main types: woven fibres and non-woven fibres. Woven fibre silt curtains are made by interlacing long threads or yarns, creating a strong and durable fabric. On the other hand, non-woven fibre silt curtains are made by entangling short fibres together using mechanical, chemical, or thermal techniques. Both types effectively serve their purpose of preventing silt from spreading, but they differ in terms of construction and material properties.</p></p>
