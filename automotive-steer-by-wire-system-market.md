<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Steer-by-wire System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pure Electronic</li><li>Backup Mechanical</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive steer-by-wire system market consists of two main types: pure electronic and backup mechanical. In the pure electronic system, the steering control is entirely electronic, without the need for any mechanical components. This type offers precise control, rapid response, and allows for advanced driver assistance features. On the other hand, the backup mechanical system incorporates a secondary mechanical system that acts as a failsafe in case of electronic failures. This ensures the driver can retain basic steering functionality even if the electronic system malfunctions.</p></p>
