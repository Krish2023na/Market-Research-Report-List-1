<p><strong>The Agricultural Micronutrients Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Soil</li><li>Foliar</li><li>Fertigation</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The agricultural micronutrients market consists of three main application methods: soil, foliar, and fertigation. Soil application involves mixing micronutrients with soil before planting to ensure their availability throughout the growing season. Foliar application involves spraying micronutrients directly onto the leaves, allowing for quick absorption and addressing immediate nutrient deficiencies. Fertigation is the process of applying micronutrients through irrigation systems, allowing for precise and efficient delivery directly to the roots of plants. These application methods play a crucial role in enhancing plant growth, yield, and overall crop quality.</p></p>
