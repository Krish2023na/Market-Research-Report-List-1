<p><strong>The Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment (HBOT) Devices Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wound Healing</li><li>Decompression Sickness</li><li>Air or Gas Embolism</li><li>Infection Treatment</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment (HBOT) devices are used in various applications, including wound healing, decompression sickness, air or gas embolism, infection treatment, and others. In wound healing, HBOT promotes oxygen supply to damaged tissues, aiding in the healing process. Decompression sickness occurs when divers surface too quickly, and HBOT helps rapidly decrease nitrogen levels in the body. Similarly, HBOT is employed in air or gas embolism cases to remove bubbles from the blood vessels. For infections, the higher oxygen levels delivered by HBOT inhibit the growth of anaerobic bacteria. Other applications may include radiation injury, carbon monoxide poisoning, and cerebral palsy.</p></p>
