<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diabetic Therapeutic Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sulphonylureas</li><li>Biguanides</li><li>Meglitinides</li><li>Thiazolidinediones</li><li>Alpha-glucosidase Inhibitors</li><li>DPP-4 Inhibitors</li><li>SGLT-2 Inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Diabetic Therapeutic Market comprises several types of medications used to treat diabetes. Sulphonylureas stimulate the pancreas to release more insulin, while Biguanides decrease the amount of glucose produced by the liver. Meglitinides also stimulate insulin release but work faster than sulphonylureas. Thiazolidinediones make cells more sensitive to insulin. Alpha-glucosidase Inhibitors slow down the breakdown of carbohydrates. DPP-4 Inhibitors increase insulin production and decrease glucose production. SGLT-2 Inhibitors lower blood sugar levels by causing excess glucose to be excreted in the urine. These medications help manage blood sugar levels in diabetic patients.</p></p>
