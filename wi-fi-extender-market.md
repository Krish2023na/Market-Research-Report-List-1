<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wi-Fi Extender Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wi-Fi Range Extender</li><li>Wireless AP Router</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Wi-Fi extender market can be divided into two key types: Wi-Fi range extenders and wireless access point (AP) routers. Wi-Fi range extenders are devices that receive the Wi-Fi signal from the router and amplify it, allowing it to reach areas with weak or no signal. They help expand the coverage area of the Wi-Fi network. On the other hand, wireless AP routers act as a central hub, connecting multiple devices wirelessly to the network. They provide a more stable and seamless internet connection in larger spaces or commercial settings.</p></p>
