<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wave Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Filters</li><li>Passive Filters</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Wave filters are used in electronic circuits to control and manipulate the characteristics of electrical signals. There are two main types of wave filters: active filters and passive filters. Active filters use active components such as transistors or operational amplifiers to amplify or attenuate specific frequency components of a signal. On the other hand, passive filters use passive components such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors to achieve the desired filtering effect without the need for additional power supply. Both types of filters have their own advantages and applications depending on the specific requirements of the circuit.</p></p>
