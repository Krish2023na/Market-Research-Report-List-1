<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sphalerite Ore Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fe>8%</li><li>Fe<8%</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sphalerite ore market types are categorized based on the iron (Fe) content in the ore. The Fe>8% market refers to sphalerite ore containing more than 8% iron, which is considered high-grade ore. It is desirable for industries that require a high iron content as it typically yields more iron when processed. On the other hand, the Fe<8% market represents sphalerite ore with less than 8% iron, considered lower grade. This ore is commonly used in industries where a lower iron content is acceptable or in the production of zinc.</p></p>
