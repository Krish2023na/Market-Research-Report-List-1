<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polymethyl Methacrylate Sheet Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Extruded</li><li>Cast</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) sheet market can be divided into two main types: extruded and cast. </p><p>Extruded PMMA sheets are manufactured by pushing the raw material through a die, resulting in a continuous sheet. This process offers high productivity and cost efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale production. On the other hand, cast PMMA sheets are produced by pouring the material into a mold and allowing it to solidify. This method provides better optical properties and a smoother surface, making it ideal for applications where clarity and appearance are crucial, but it is more expensive and time-consuming compared to extrusion.</p></p>
